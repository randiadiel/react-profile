We organize all of the webinars and events using a free video conference (Google Meet) which not have a waiting room available. As a Chief Product Officer I then got an idea to make a website for our events' participants to wait. Iam also embedding our online media filemagz.com for people to read while waiting the events to start. With this website, our online media website got some referral traffic from the events while makin our events' participants comfortable.",
